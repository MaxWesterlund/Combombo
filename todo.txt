* push bomb out of wall
* bomb collider smaller (not for selecting)
* player should be more predictable and deterministic (the same bombs should produce the same result)

* backgrounds
* fullscreen? resolution adapt (project settings)
* load custom levels not working if many weird files in same directory?

* levels

extra:
* download levels
* more tiles

problems:
* kan inte vinna innan alla bomber spr√§ngs
* folk upplever bomb hotbar som skum
